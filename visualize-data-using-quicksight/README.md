## Configure QuickSight to visualize data

**Step 1**: Create an S3 bucket to store your files

**Step 2**: Upload the necessary files on the bucket youâ€™ve created

**Step 3**: Edit your JSON file, add the specific URI link of your csv file	

**Step 4**: Go to QuickSight on the management console and set up your account (if you will use this service for the first time)
- Create a unique name for your quicksight
- Note: During your set up, always remember that your s3 region should be the same as your quicksight.
